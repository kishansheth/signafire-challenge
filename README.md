Welcome to the Signafire Interview Challenge!


We're using this assignment as a way to assess your knowledge, ability to learn, and software architecture inclinations.

Background:
We are taking on two interns this summer and they could be more front end, full stack or back end (we call it API here). There is also an open internship position on the data pipeline team. If you're more interested in that please [talk to gurgen about their take home test]
Thus - if you're more interested in front end please focus on making the front end work thoroughly (and implementing features in a front end way where posssible) and doing the extra features for front end.
If you're more interested in backend work please focus on making the APIs work well (and implementing features in a back end way where posssible) and doing the extra features for API.
If you're full stack please build out the shared features from both sides well.

This test should be completed in javascript. For the front end vanilla js or React/ Angular 2+/ Vue are all acceptable. For the backend please use Node and Express. Submissions in other languages will not be assessed.
